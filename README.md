# NGUI
CSS and Angularjs components framework for developing your projects.


## Installation

### NPM
Add to your `package.json` file:

```
"dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.6.2",
    "ngui": "github:cervgon/ngui"
}
```
or

```
npm install cervgon/ngui --save
```

#### Test

```
npm install
npm start
```

#### Export CSS
```
npm run build:css
```
These generates a folder called dist with all the CSS minified and the javascript necessary to use the components:

```
dist/
---ngui.css
---ngui.min.js
---ngui.min.js.map

```
